<html><p style = "font-size:2em;" align = "center">There is a common misunderstanding about absolute values. For example, let's say we have | -x |. Most would jump to say that | -x | = x. This is inherently incorrect. Why is this so? Well let x = -5, and let's use the proposed formula | -x | = x.<br>| -(-5) | = | 5 | = 5 â‰  -5. Hence, the proposed formula | -x | = x is incorrect.</p></html>
<html><p style = "font-size:2em;" align = "center">So what is the correct formula? Well we have to consider three possibilities. If x is greater than 0, positive. If x is less than 0, negative. If x is equal to 0.<br>x > 0, positive<br>x &lt; 0, negative<br>x = 0, zero</p></html>
<html><p style = "font-size:2em;" align = "center">If x is greater than 0, then it will always equal x.<br>| x | = x if x > 0.<br>If x is less than 0, then it will always equal the <i>opposite</i> of x.<br>| x | = -x if x &lt; 0.<br>If x is equal to 0, then it will always equal x.<br>| x | = x, if x = 0.</p></html>
